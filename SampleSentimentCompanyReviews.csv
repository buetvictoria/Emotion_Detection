"You will get tired of working but you can't finish your work due to cross functional role, there will be too may functions need to be handled by individual, in which it is impossible to maintain constancy.  resulting unhappy managers towards you. High Expectations are set which can't be maintained by an individual in constant manner, which makes you unhappy at work after period of time."

You tend to get lost in the big maze of Infosys. Lots of processes and guidelines. I had joined as a fresher so it was good. Laterals have limited opportunities.

You need to know all the systems to survive in the job. The job culture was really good. The team mates were really helpful. The manager was really supportive. A place where you can learn a lot.
you need to earn to work
You need to be at the top of your game to excel here. The premises and office ambience is impeccable. The training team will ensure that you possess the right skills before moving into production.
You have the freedom to express your thoughts and also complains to the Leads without worrying about anything as it would be between you and your lead and action would be taken if necessary.
You can learn many new things.. Many opportunities for career development. Great guidelines from team leader..
You can grow if you want to in IBM.Its always gives you pride to be working for an IT Gaint. Internal job postings will be there..you can switch to your ideal role
"You can gain experience. Good place to work, helpful colleagues. Salary hike depends on your performance so if you perform well there is a good chance of getting promoted at the early stage of the whole promotion thing."
"Yes, certain handicaps, restraints, ambiguity is there but now I do sincerely realize that in all IT companies at large. Confidentiality and Intellectual Property Rights norms are stringent."
"Yes learnt many things, but need to work extended hours for most of the time and no extra payment for that. Enjoyable part is a good team to work with. Grown up there as a lead web developer."
Yes it was a good company for any employee.And they have good product to selling the customer.

"With freedom to develop and execute new ideas, you are trusted with full ownership of your work. New thinking is encouraged and managers are extremely approachable with any idea/issue or even a  general chat. There are also regular feedback sessions followed by suggestions on charting out your next career achievement. All in all, a very pleasant and fun company to work at. The only and major drawback are the multiple processes and clearances required for the simplest of things such as hardware requirements or team events. If there can be better synchronization between the various levels of IT, finance and transport teams, then it would make the employee's life much easier."
"With every passing day, I learn more about the RightNow product. My co-workers are friendly and assist me where I am stuck and I too do the same. Best part of work is debugging the code. And hardest part is waiting for response from teammates in USA"
"With cognizant everything is fine at the very first place salary, perk and work culture. The only thing missing is a solid hierarchic intervention in term with control. Else is a blissful place to work !"

we used to work for american customer they were good in terms of their money was enjoyable at work used to have fun Friday every week to boost the advisors
we used to enjoy the work as collection Person.. We used to handle Personal Loan Accounts Regarding Citi Financial Services We used to get good support from our Managers
We use to sit in Mckinsey and Company on behalf of American express . Good atmosphere all together . But if you talk about American express no managment at all . Working without a leader from last 4 months . Need to Grow and ready to do any type of Hardwork for that
"we start with checking any pending issues, this happens thru email screening, then daily routine of checking on KPIs, the required activities, sales team in place, customer visits, product discussions and pending approvals. Then depends on which part are we in the month, sales and distribution activity might be a more occupying activity. Also depends on which part are we in the year focus might be on budget exercises. I learned a lot on product, budgeting, leadership and a lot of what really matters. Management allows people to excel and even if they are not believing they make sure individuals get a fair chance to demonstrate success. - The hardest was to control the resistance of frequent changes. - The best part was learning and achieving new records"
"we should learn the products ourselves and pitch for the sale No helping nature by our reporting managers. Managers don't have proper knowledge on the product and they put lots of pressure on us to do sales. When we ask for help to talk with the customer they tell some work reasons and inform another colleague to talk with the customer. They don't want to know where the employee is lacking and how to build him up giving their sales experience. Instead of on rolls AXIS Bank Managers, 3rd party Serco and Concentrics Managers are far better they have CORE knowledge on AXIS Bank product knowledge. WORST HR's EVER HAD. There is a value and importance of the mail written to the HR department and senior HR's, but no one bothers and replies even though we top-up to the mail written by the employee. Lots of attitude to the HR people. Benefits: If we do sales then we will have numerous rewards which can help in our career  Axis Bank Managers treat us like Human Beings, not Animals."

Very Easyaly working
Very difficult to have work life balance in this organisation. AS a staff I have never felt a window where a staff can openly discuss his challenges and to ask for some support. Its a very political situation out there in the organisation

used to have very good infrastructure with spacious cafeterias and indoor games facilities were good. have great communities for various activities which help you learn or enhance your personality.
Updating books of accounts and Assisting Seniors in performing Internal and Statuary audits
"Unnecessary work pressure & No Social Life. The reporting of employees is on hourly basis. There is no scope for professional growth. They seldom transfer you to internal openings. Also the HR is non responsive. If someone complaints about any wrong doing by their immediate boss, the human resource staff ask the boss itself about it. Obiously, who would not defend himself. So the HR is typical non existence. At the time of final appraisals, you won't be ranked as per the KRA's instead you would be ranked as per the bell curve & the reason provided is that the bank has too much staff & mere working efficiently doesn't means that you would be given high ratings."
Undesirable IT working experience.
Unable to balance personal life with work life. Since I join this company I m working over the weekend as well. We almost spend our 12 to 13 hours in office.
UK shift with shift maximum ending time is 3am as per UK timing. Fun place to work in. Well organized & supportive co-workers.
"Typicaly day at work: That’s an interesting question. I love Mondays, mostly because the day flies by in a flash. On a given day, during the early hours you will find me monitoring maximum calls as fresh mind helps me catch every error like that.. I do call callibs on mondays so that the rest of the week can be utilised in executing the policies and filling compliance gaps with operations.   Friday evening surprises. Rest of the week goes in delivering the product(s), updating the status with the client, answering emails and calls from our global teams. My role involves extensive management responsibilities and staying organized is not an option.  •what you learned: For my entire tenure with various organisations tilss date i have learned that self realisation is the key to sucess and work-life balance. Once we know what we are good at and we know are flaws we will be able to give out our best leading to job satisfaction-stability-outstanding performance-recognition-succuess.  •management I believe in my leadership completely , i have the entire space to reach out to them.  •your co-workers I work with a very competitive team in a healthy way that somehow helps me compete with myself on daily basis. We never shy out to reach to each other irrespective of our bands and tenures with the organisation.   •the hardest part of the job I would not say that this is the hardest part because this is the main contributer for day to day learning and improvement in me, but still as a quality analyst i cant even afford to make a single error where in there are certain tools"
Typical workday starts in the afternoon since the projects are all US based. You will learn a lot about time management. You have a chance to interact directly with the clients which is a very rare opportunity and this helps a lot in furthering your career. Lots of on-site opportunities which is a wonderful experience.

"Typical Day at work involves managing a team of 7 people for a client project, daily status updates and mail communication/followups, collating project management related data for the client.  Time management and working with a team having different strength and weakness- is a good learning. Workplace culture is good and array of employee engagement activities flourish. Hardest part of job is to keep up pace with dynamic client requirements and the enjoyable part is to find creative ways in making an assignment/project look engaging and interactive."
"Typical day at work at capgemini can start anytime as it quite flexible to tymings.  To handle work along with clients requirements is good to learn.  The hardest part is delivering to client who is very ambitious about the project it has given to us, as some of the requirements come new to the whole team. At that time you are on your own to drive your problem and find a solution to it. Fun activities are enjoyable and participation brings us together with other teams. Quizes organised virtually across months are also fun."

time management
"Tienen una cultura laboral muy amigable y respetable, lo cual hace que el trabajo sea mas agradable"
Three and a half years of training undergone at Deloitte laid the platform for helping me evolve as a Finance Professional.
Though the days were hectic interms of work with so many clients to be worked upon. There was always a scope for learning.
Though the company identified to be one of the largest banks in the world. the work in one of the service centers located in Visakhapatnam is unstable. managers are not experienced in managing people and surround himself with yes -men micromanagers every aspect of everything. they change directions at his whim constantly. the management doesn't have any vision or objectives in their work. incredibly backward thinking and inevitable knowledge on process makes the work very much shady and uninteresting
Though company doesn't exist anymore the job was pretty good with the environment making you come to work everyday. The culture was good and so was the work life balance
"Though Cognizant is said to be fastest growing IT consultancy, ther personal career growth would be minimal. You'd be in a typical IT company with same boring management and same chores. A lot of projects are support projects which would destroy the career."
"Those who work hard, they get the maximum workload. No managerial skill. They give importance to quantity and not quality. Bad IT support and systems."
"Those three words describe American Express. Thats the best company anyone can work with to learn earn and have fun. management is very welcoming. If you are a hard worker and you want to do something big and earn big.. Amex is your option. I have worked with Amesx for over 3 years and the only reason why I had to quit Amex was because I had to relocate to Pune because I got married, There is no reason why anyone would leave t=this wonderful Company. Its the best trust me"
this workplace is very good.
"This was the best training ground for me. I learnt the basics of the BPO Industry. The growth opportunity is high in this place. When it comes to walk the talk regarding Work - Balance lifestyle, it lacks in it. Especially, in the Customer Service based departments or departments where there is an interaction with the Customers / Clients."
"This was my first step into the corporate world after completing my masters. It has lot of competitions. I have learned to have patience and deal with the customers, Also to have cordial relations with colleagues. The management was good. The work atmosphere was OK, can deal with it. The hardest part was to understand the work culture. The most enjoyable part was the work & operations which made me teach Finacle software."
This was my first playground where I realised no more school or college days in store for me. Team was like family and manager was like an elder sister. Everything that I am today is because of my base. And my base is in those 4 letters HSBC.
"This was my first job in the corperate and I should tell you, I have had the best time and this experience has taught me the ways I can explore and the path to choose in which I am interestted in.  My daily work included the following: Communication with stakeholders with a problem solving attitude( USA and Canada). - Understanding the issue and make best use of the available resources to resolve the issue. - Able to systematically escalate problems or variance in the information to the relevant owners and teams and follow through on the resolutions to ensure they are delivered. - Ensuring to surpass all performance and quality goals - Demonstrated ownership to resolve challenging customer issues, escalating when necessary. - Excellent communication, both verbal and written as one will be required to communicate with the Customers, Customer Service Associates, Delivery Station Managers, Delivery Associates in real time. Develop and/or understand performance metrics to assist with driving business results."
This was my first job and i was very excited for it. A typical day starts from morning 11 a.m to 8 p.m. I learned a lot over here. I was exposed to the professional ethics and the work environment over here. Co-workers are very helpful in Deloitte. The hardest part of the job is when we have to stay back at work and for some urgent deadlines. It is okay if it is once in a while but continuously for two months is a pain. We used to work for 12-14 hrs in a day. The best part is the free lunches we used to get during this season and also team-outings for like 4-5 times in a year. How can forget the Impact day. This was the best way of doing my bit to the society.
This was my first IT workplace. They have an awesome campus. There is a lot of flexibility to work. Work from home facility is available. Fewer layoffs so we have safe jobs.
This was my first employer right after my graduation. A very good company on Healthcare Front. Recognition's to emloyees were too good. I believe would love to work here.
This was my first company after my Undergrad. It is a product based company and the competition is cut-throat. I worked at the Dell India R&D which stands for Research and Development.
This was from 2007 to 2011 - they gave no increments to anyone in the whole LIMIC department - there was high attrition when I was there. Heavy politics.
This was a super duper place to work. They were so considerate towards women. I used to wait to go to work in the morning. I thoroughly enjoyed working with this company. Given a chance I would like to work here again.
This was a good job. Managment was very helpfull for new people. Atmosphere was very good where any one adjust. Seniors  are very good and helpfull in job.
"This this one of the best company in my views  The accenture gives you alot like your career,your education if you want to study more.  Also teach how to be a professional  Best management system they have.  Work life balance  Awesome work environment."
This place is very relaxed and perfect for people who want to retire no stress no pressure people are taken care of and salary is not great but for work life balance it works
"This place is like a market, you can easily sell here. you will be forced to work in any project, hiring for a project releasing them is common here"
"This place is a great place to work. The people there are great and understanding. You can talk to anyone there about work, life, or anything. They will be a part of the team that this place provides. Hi, thank you for your review. Glad to hear that you are having a pleasant experience growing within HGS. Wish you all the best in your future endeavors."
"This place has made me a professional, taught me skills which helped me to become what I'm today.  I'll always be thankful to my trainers, manager and colleagues from this fantastic organisation"
"This place has made me a professional, taught me skills which helped me to become what I'm today.   I'll always be thankful to my trainers, manager and colleagues from this fantastic organisation"
"This place has a Very Good work environment. Majority crowd working here is young, like less than 30 years old, so the place is full of energy. they give pick-up & drop cabs etc. It's a pretty cool place to work. Most managers I've met focus on having a good Work-Life balance for their employees, hence, most of the days working has between 9-10 hours, although that may vary for every individual."
This place has a lot of freshers and it creates a fun environment. Management is good. Except for the salary everything else is good. Pay is less here.
This organization helped me in gaining multiple skills over the period of time I was there. It promotes good worklife balance for the employees leading to a good culture.

Retail banking , Staff Training, Travel to branches , interactions with inner cities branch staffs and customers, Offsite meetings and gala functions.Being a part of a first nationwide sales team surely is exalting and is so motivating that even at times of missing the sales target or budgeted income one cannot be de-motivated but take resolute stand to fix things for the forthcoming year.

This is good. But from 2 yrs there were more restrictions which does'nt benefit the employees. And people who are in the company for long time are in the worst sutuation today. They are getting less salary compared to a PA came from other company. Normalization should happen in salalry as well along with rating.

This is a good company to give a kick start to your career but that totally depends upon the account you are working for.
This is a Fun place. It is not a company. similar to this is a cinema theatre. waste company. no salary hike and no promotion. waste interviews. managers talk very bad.
"This is a European firm and is going through an evolution at a steady pace. Based on the company policies, the general feeling is that it is an average pay master, which is true. A few opportunities to work with some of the best managers in the industry though."

"This company is completely a processed based company, which is good thing. Helps to grow in the company."
"This company is an excellent place to work, provided you have a good manager to report to. This company gives you a lot of opportunities to grow in your profession, and in general, could qualify as your dream company to work with, except for the fact that it houses some of the worst people managers you are ever likely to encounter under one roof. Somehow, when this unit was started in 2011, in its haste to get employees onboard quickly, it took in a lot of 'trash' without proper filtration, and in  away it is paying the price now, but overall EGI India in general, is a great place to work."
This company is a place where one can get job satisfaction from balance at work and great work enviornment.. Its a home away from home.
This company is a perfect launchpad for the freshers. You will have ample breathing period for the transformation from student to employee. Once the transformation is complete you need to look for an actual job or else you will be struck here for a lifetime of nothing.
This company is a good work place for freshers. The training given here is the best ever training one could get. The training helps us gain lots of knowledge
This company has the best workplace culture. Flexible work timings.

This company environment boosted my confidence. We had a wonderful time working together and more importantly I learnt a lot during my tenure at this company. Given a chance I'll definately work here again
This company being a financial institution taught me a lot in terms of work management and time management. The most enjoyable part of the work was the recognition given by the company to each of the employer. I grew each day with the knowledge provided by both trainers and the company. Overall a very good and genuine place to get experience which would benefit any employee in his future endeavors.
This banking company is job good. Banking security is good. Company culture is good. Job is secure. Customer frankly bank.job culture is tension free.
This bank has huge volumes of all kind of customers in trade (i.e. large corporate to very small retail company. So accordingly one can learn handling all kind of customers.
"They should look after the salary structure so the employees can fulfill their family basic needs happily. As far as I am concerned I 'd say that I as a employee was working in Bangalore and getting 13000 INR to 15000 INR was really very hard for me to bear the cost of rent, food and other expenses in those pathetic salary. They must provide good salary. Anyways, it was nice and good company."
"They provide us really good facilities, the breaks are very short and need to be punctual, stress free environment and work, management is really great too."
They need to cooperate with new interns. Money doesn't matters always i believe the productivity of individuals matters so it can automatically increase the productivity of a company.
"They have rotational shifts, and no weekend offs. So, if you are a person who does not have/ want to build a personal life, then Amazon is the place of your dreams."
They have introduced new methodology of appraisal which is very difficult for many to achieve because of the mandatory certifications which need to be completed
They have good infrastructure and they do care about the people but they are more dependent on freshers rather than building leaders.
They dont have any good project. They just use freshers as labours. Some managers give the work which even a 12th standard student can do it if he knows ms-office.
"These guys are cheats! Extremely employee unfriendly. They churn out profit by deducting employee salary, bonuses and pay the least in market"
"These company are shipping products very good. Every product inspected before delivery,before delivery every item will go picking then conso after it, it's go for packing and dispatch for delivery and then it is ready for delivery"
"These big MNCs are not for everyone. If you are really passionate about programming/modern technologies, don’t go there. There is a risk in it but you can grow with the company and reach heights. You will be up to date with modern technologies since all of the small companies are ready to adapt new technologies.  If you just need a job with an average salary and be in a safe zone, goto Accenture, do whatever they assign and stay there forever. You might get onsite opportunities as well if you are looking for this. Listen, you might work in night shifts as well."
"There were hardships times to learn new technology Oracle, which they gave intensive trainings and learn more"
there was no presser of sales targets on employee and very help full and motivated support by senior's and company trainer's.
There was no any problem with this company but one mistake of all persons of my team become a big problem for my team so that i have taken the responsibility of the said mistake and resigned.
There was good work and life balance. Good people around with nice management. There are lot of job roles within the company to apply after a recognizable tenure.
"There was good experince I got while working in Axis Bank. I leant more things as how the loan processes, What KYC documents required, how to calculate loan eligibility of loan Applicants etc. so that experience is very important to me to learn about checking of financial statements."
There so many opportunities and training will be provided to the employees for their professional and personal growth.
There needs to be improvement culture for innovation and new idea generation. Lot of groupism. 
There is very good balance between Work & Life.
There is very best HR management rules very nice they provide 
There is so much to learn based on which account you have been selected in. If you are a fresher then there is so much to learn in tcs. It is a good company to join as a fresher.
"There is not typical work & i have learned lots of skills & knowledges , management is good supporting & also our co-workers are co-ordinate with each other & solve issue the same"
There is not even a single where I or my colleague thought of work pressure.Its fun and learning to be in such a good environment.
There is no work life balance in HDFC Bank...
There is no work life balance & the people need to slog everyday.
There is no proper communication from HR team and management team but good disciplined company and disciplined labours without intimating they removed the associates and supervisors
"there is no process and most of thing happen on verbally ,no email and no plan for any task . otherwise my team was good and i have great experince with them"
There is no much grouth in officer level and long working hours. I didn't get quality time to spend with my family and friends and the work profile.    .
There is no bad product in this company.All the people choosing this company than others because it delivers very fastly and delivered good products...
"There is immense learning that one can take at this place. A typical day at the branch will give you so many experiences in terms of operations, handling customer queries etc... due to the wide reach."
"There is good work ambiance in Accenture, which includes people, team work and the comfort. There is good infrastructure. Food facilities can be improved."
"There is good management. I have learned a lot of management concept.  I faced a lot of challenges/problems, but finally i got success. Now i have a  lot of reporting solution of BOXI."
There is definitely no doubt as to why Amex turns up in the list of top favourite places to work.
There is a lot to learn and its very relaxed and friendly culture. Multiple teams are there in Amazon. Its easy to take IJP as per the employee interest and knowledge.
"There is a lot of mis management in project allocations. Also with merger with Igate, there is little clarity on roles and responsibilities. This year increments took a deep dive resulting in dissatisfaction among the employees. But yes, there is better work life balance as compared to other companies."
"There is a good work life balance but it doesn't stay the same Always.  The facilities are good but again the management is not upto the mark, the projects are not well organised"
"There I was on cash counter . I learned alot from there, management is good, my co-workers are very supportive."
"There have been many of those typical days at work but, one that I would like to share is the day when I volunteered for the Launch of Inclusion in Deloitte India Offices. I got to meet a lot of people from different backgrounds and it was a wonderful learning experiece. It was motivating too, when the leaders spoke to us and thanked us for the work that we had put-in in making this event a success.  There is a lot that I learned in Deloitte - I have grown personally as well as professioanally. The trainings given, be it related to work, communication or self development have been very helpful. I had an  opprotunity to work with people from different cultures and backgrounds. I was also given an opportunity to master my skills in MS Excel and now I use these skills to train my teammates on the same.  The Management here in Deloitte is well balanced. We have great leaders who make sure that we are given the right oppotunities that will help us grow. Co-workers are supportive too and we work like a family here.  There is nothing hardest as such but I would call it challenging whenever we are given a project to handle on our own and we have to deliver them according to the timelines.  The most enjoyable part is when we are involved in other activities such as fun events, Impact Day - this is held once in a year where we choose a group (thread) and do something impactful - such as visiting schools and having some fun activities for the children or visiting old aged homes, cleaning the lakes, zoo, etc. I was also given an opprotunity to play for the Deloitte Corporate Vollyebal"
There are many opportunities to learn and grow. We could approach anyone to discuss work related issues.
"there are lots of Opportunities to learn including online and classroom  training , work life balance is also there ...you can go for it without a doubt !"
There are lots of opportunities for learning and tuning ur skill sets.All kind of internal and external certification available and Infosys is knowledge hub.
There are lots of improvements management should do but overall a good learning experience for a fresher. Work does get monotonous after few months...
There are lots of apportunity to learn more regarding process.Inovative ideas are always welcome over there & gets implemented if its good one.
"There are lot of training related your technology , you can learn new things every day, work culture is good. Fully supported by management,technically good growth"
There are lot of flexibility for employees and job security
There are good and bad things about this company as rated above. Non existence of IJP makes selection in transparent .
There are better in management to maintain the balance in both side.
"There are a lot of pros working for Accenture. They have great career opportunities, a never ending supply of interesting work, competitive compensation, wonderful benefits, great people, wonderful training programs, a tremendous number of brilliant professionals in their fields ready to help, and great core values."
The workplace was very relaxed and my managers were very good and understanding of the workplace. Our shifts were very flexible and there were possibilities to earn more through overtime
The workplace is fun.. The co workers are helping and co operative... The environment  is productive. The learning part is more.management is supportive.
The workplace environment has been real good.The most enjoyable part of the job is that we get to learn new things every single day and the timings utilised inside the ODC has always been productive.
The workplace diversity and leadership principles are very helpful to excel in one's respective role. There are ample opportunities available for one to explore and work which makes employees strive towards success.
"The workplace culture is flexible. Lots of fun activities organized by HSBC. Learned about the business flows, analytics, and Corporate banking problems"
"The workplace culture at Dell is one of the best. It gives you the freedom to do anything within the company policies. Achieving your target and goals are the most important things of the company. You get a lots of goodies, appreciations and awards for your performance and discipline. Unplanned leaves are a big no-no. Very homely place to work and lots of fun activities like Friday Fun and QBR.  Good growth based on your performance and discipline."
The workload is often huge but it is a small price for the innumerous opportunites and career paths one is free to pursue. Accenture constantly strives to upskill all employees and give them a competitive market advantage.
The working hours are too long(10 Hours and 20 Minutes) also the salary is very less as compared to working hours. Beside this everything thing is perfect.
The working environment is very friendly. There are many departments where you can learn and grow. You get a wider scope in the competitive world. But the growth is short.
"The working environment is Friendly. Refresh Process pieces of training will be scheduled whenever there is an Update. Rewards and Recognitions occur every month to Motivate associates. Hi, thank you for taking the time to share your experience at HGS. At HGS, we aim to provide a good work environment and recognize and reward our employees for their hard work.

"The working environment  was stress full , cut throat competition and limited products to sell. no direct connection with customer. products were out of date and bit expensive as compare to other products in market."
The working Culture is very good and the fellow workers are very helpful and friendly. The company policies are good and have many policies without any gender biasing.
"The working culture is much better than other service based industries in India. (That’s my experience overall) The leave policies (medical, vacation, for mothers as well) is pretty good."
The working culture is good.but salary package is not well for programmers or B.sc students even if we are working same as other technical guys. Other things are good.
The work which you do everyday some times feels very routine and you might get bored. You don't get much to learn if you are in a non technical process. The management and culture of work is fun loving and very professional at the same time.
"The work was challenging. The best part about it was the flexi-timings. You can work from anywhere you want and at whatever time you wish, just that finish your job in the given time period and everyone's happy :) A typical day at work was quite relaxed. People were friendly and technically very sound."
"The Work satisfaction is mainly based on the project and a team,  if you are in a good project and  team then it will good for your growth as you get more exposure on the skill sets."
The work responsibility at Amex was not good. It did not appeal to me as challenging. It was more a duplicating work than strategic and creative thinking work contrary to the job title.
"The work pressure is more as compared to the salary and there is no job security... You have to achieve your sales target with lots of paper work , sometimes its difficult to achieve the target due to lots of documentations.."
The work place was very good. I really learned a lot. It helped me in improving my coding skills. Good place to work.
"The Work Place was good with the facilities provided also the management was good and supportive. Learned about the banking facilities, the various products of bank and also many of the banking transactions such as Online Banking, RTGS, NEFT, Cheque clearing, various loan products, complaints solving and so on."

The work like was balanced and the work place and environment was motivating and pleasant i enjoyed my initial years working here.
"The work life balance at this company is good as we have many activities that take place, with events taking place and also the festivals here are celebrated with enthusiasm."
The work is hectic almost all days with lots of learning involved.  The management is interactive.  The co- Workers are cooperative.  The hardest part of the job is the volume of data which is generally huge for reconciliation.  The most enjoyable part of the job is when you see everyone around you passionate working and motivating to achieve the targets provided.
The work is flexible with good work balance but the salary is quite low in comparison. Few Accounts have the flexibility of wfh which becomes handy and the job security is excellent.
The work I did in Oracle was very diverse. I got to work and learn with different teams and people from Oracle Offices across the world.
"The Work environment was very good. Training programs also good and many things I'm learning about Telecom.The most enjoyable part in the job is R&R. GREAT!!!!!!!

"The work environment is fun at Amazon, however, the work environment is dynamic so you will be continuously facing new challenges that for you to work."
The work environment in the organization is very balanced. A lot is based on the kind of project you are in. Overall organization policies are employee friendly. The level of complexity of projects is also decent. There are opportunities to learn for the those who are curious.
The work culture is very satisfying. Handsome incentive structures with co-operative personel. The company has a very professional approach with a very good client base. The only dissatisfying part is the long work hours.
The work culture is so dynamic! I've never had a boring day at work and have learnt so much and worked with people with such varied styles of leadership.
The Work culture is great and helps us balance personal life with our work life. The facilities like cab pick up and drop from the door step ensure safety of every individual.
The work Culture is good. The employees are helpful. Many events are conducted to make change in monotonous work. Compensation is average. Bus facility of employees all across mumbai.
the work culture is good however the pay structure needs to be reformed.
The work culture is good and there is no fuss about working from home in times of need.
"The work culture is fine but there must be some guide for caree growth. There is no job security if the project is ou of hand. There is a option to switch projects internally but, no one will hire from it. Nedd to improve on that part. A oppourtunity must be given for talanted persons."
The work culture is fine and the management is taking care employee . But it is not a good company to start your carrier because of most of the project is based on services provider so learing chances is less in the same type job security and work ethics balance is wonderful.
"The work culture is excellent, with great opportunities and amazing people to work with. Lot of learning and exposure, to come up with ideas and showcase the talent."
"The work culture in the bank was very friendly and encouraging everyone who like to enjoy the work, highly appreciative. I could develop a lot in the culture."
"The work always started early in the morning with high volume of mails. After reading all the mails, priortiztion was set for all deliverables. Most important learning was how to priortize work and meet all the deadlines. Management and co workers were supportive and friendly at work. We all enjoyed the working with each other. The most enjoyable part was my work as thats my passion and I live for it during business days."
"The whole environment they have created to work and have fun activities are awesome, more then that they care fort each employee from security to harasment for everything they have a legal action and they follow that, Although I left company because my education is different from that field, Otherwise I always suggest for that place to work."
"The very best place for any beginner to start his career. The training will be provided by one of the bests in the industry. Freshers will have diverse options to choose a career at Accenture. Since it is a service based company, most of the top 100 Fortune based company are its clients. I would highly recommend everyone to choose their career at Accenture"
The value system of the company is noteworthy. The company has managed to keep this alive over time and across its new hires. This is most visible in challenging times or when dealing with difficult situations. This is a company to build long-term careers or join early in your career to have an exposure to professional workplace practices.

"The typical day starts off with a team meeting and tea which helps us know what are the priority tasks for the day. I learned time management, building good relationships with colleagues in office experience and also the technical learning. The workplace culture is healthy and competitive but off late there are changes in the management and policies is quiet stringent."
"The type of work here as investigator, I liked the work profile. The main problem with the economic of any country is the  black money and converting the black money to  legitimate money is the main thing the fraudsters do. And my job is to investigate the transactions and source of funds so that the it is assured that the transactions are not unusual one."
The training offered by them in simply world class. You can become a good programmer even if you have zero programming language. The hardest part of the job is when you are on bench.But there are so much of facilities available for you to freshen up your stressed day.
The training given was very informative and the working atmosphere was friendly. A place were we can learn while being productive for the organisation.
"The title of the review summarizes it all.  You get to work with a fast-paced team, smart minds, leadership principles oriented, and a fun loving peers. You've got in-house doctors(or a nurse), floor play areas, good food at cafeteria, and many other perks.  Ensure to work hard that you get recognized timely. Prod + Leadership principle combined projects will evidently help you succeed at the world's best customer centric organization."
The time I spend working in Concentrix was pretty good. The work environment is really very good as well as the management too. An employee with skills required is promoted to the next level very soon and .which is the best part of the company.
The three and a half years spent at Deloitte have been amazing. This company gives you the opportunity to grow both professionally and personally. The work life balance is good and the people/environment/work culture is of top standard :-)
The technology what they use is latest and they are not stick on old technologies. It helps the person to grow his career and get strong in their technology
"The team leads are always there to help. Good place for new graduates to start their career. The initial salary is very less but depending on your performance, you can get better positions. It is completely dependent on your work ethic and performance. It may take some time, but if you do good, you will surely be rewarded."
The Team i am in is fantastic. It's really amazing team to work with. American Express is known for its brand. I am currently working as Training Coordinator.
The summary above explains the gist of the experience. A nice place to work with awesome work-life balance. Salary and compensation could be much better when compared to the industry and this doesn't come as a surprise as Dell was never regarded as a very good paymaster.
The start of career is good with axis bank but to sustain for long term is not good because there is lot to learn in banking but you have an limited knowledge in axis bank.
The senior are not reliable the most of them don't know about how to gave duties what efficiency they are using or not understand about the table of daily working the fake knowledge of computer only knowing that is usually coming from learning the process by one by one not even read or write English for replying emails i am the top scorer  but they don't give me a chance to work and show me resign and
"The salary is good,when compared to any other companies.  The job pressure is less when compared to any other companies  My life is My company...."
"The rules and culture is changing continuously which can't be easily adapted. Nothing else than that. The growth has literally come to zero.,........."
"The role I worked with was Balance Sheet substantiation. It provided a huge amount of learning. While there were long working hours, there was also good work life balance. An added benefit was good people and their support."
"The right platform to start the career. Learnt a lot in this company as a Quality Auditor. Have received ""Performer of the Month"" multiple times, with pure talent, Hard & smart work. Management was very supportive in terms of giving an opportunity to learning things."
"The review system is based on a manager's review. Unfortunately, sometimes ur reviewer isn't from the same team. This aspect can be annoying cause your review is dependant on two people, one you actually work with and one who doesn't know much about your working style and marks you purely based on whether he or she likes you or not."
"The review depends on if you are part of a products unit or the services unit. For the product unit, the products are interesting and there are good learning opportunities. Growth rate can be better.  The work life balance is pretty good. The hours are flexible.  Workplace culture (in my unit) is average, it would be nice if employees were proactive and ready to go the extra mile to improve products.  Benefits are decent in terms of insurance and leaves.  Excellent philosophies of inclusivity and equality.  Office infrastructure at my location is basic."
"The review about the HGS one of the finest places to work along the day where it would teach a person to manage the work load and the pressure at the situation at times, the learning at the work place is a symbolic of the sine wave which allows each employee to learn the knowledge regarding the process. Hi, thank you for sharing your experience at HGS. At HGS, we aim to provide equal learning, work-life balance and growth opportunities to all. We consider your feedback and we'd like to know more. Please get in touch with us at talk2us@teamhgs.com."
The projects you would be working on are not great projects that help you catapult in your career. Low salary compared to other companies. Good training program. The environment is laid back generally you would have a couple of members doing most of the work for the team.
"The projects were very good. The pay was equivalently good. There was work life balance and the assignments were long term in different countries. Worked with the best in the industry. Would like to work with them again anytime. Once an IBMer, forever an IBMer. Made very good global colleagues and friends."
"The project is concerned with analyzing data provided by client. Studying complexity of data and identifying ways to process data to perform validations as well as observe any exceptions and queries need to be confirmed by the client. At the time after getting confirmation from client preparing final deliverable as per the requirement as well as preparing procedure memo stating all the exception, assumptions and manipulation performed during the whole process. Best part while doing project was troubleshooting on validation result. Analyzing data and recognizing different approaches to get better validation results. Each and every client result in some kind of learning. Learning of approach, observation points and while preparing final procedure memo learning the appropriate way to note the observations"
"The project I worked on had good learning and and good management. Other benefits like company bus , pick up drop were very good and comfortable for employees ."
"The project ! worked in TCS are very productive environment. The Job nature is really Good in terms of friend environment and stress free. There is no way that you could find fun at workplace is less. TCS B'lre premises is filled with entertainment, Green nature, lovely pets. Overall Good place to work"
the primary reason for me to leave the organisation was limited growth possiblity and preference is given to iit and iim .it had long work hours without any benefit
The position of tax consultant basically involves tax return preparation.
"The place where you can work with fun and productively. we can gain new experience and many learning can be done, customer centricity plays a vital role in the field of banking. person who are interested in sales has got a better growth in axis."
"The place was as fantastic as it would ever get anywhere . great people great work atmosphere . everthing was just at the best .learned a lot , grown and still using work ethics from there which is helping me to improve in life ."
"The place i am working is extremely well ,it is a 3G/4Gbased project which is a united kingdom based and also coworkers are also very co-operative.but the most hardest part is rotational shifts which is very difficult to handle."
The place and the team i worked was completely dedicative and planning. We meet the deadlines as well as we manage to have good personal space and fun moments. We help each other with their tasks. Assist or lead others work. My work was appreciated and been promoted as Associate Analyst in a span of 1 year.
The people the work the culture the work ethic i like everyday of my work at CITI
The people around you make the place more exciting. I am fortunate to have beautiful people around me in the team. The work is interesting and people are awesome.
"The part of job that i enjoyed the most is understanding operation of different sectors like telecom, technology, infra etc"
"The overall experience with an axis bank is Satisfied. I learnt so much things like customer relation, management skill, etc.  The working environment is famiier.   Overall satisfied with working culture."
"The overall experience of last 6yrs with Amex had been really amazing, however the core for which everyone is working is money if that is something that is missing it gets hard to stay motivated at work."
"The organization thrust on developing employee.they invest in employee's training and development which tuns out to be productive for the company. 5 days week culture , excellent work culture. senior management is approachable."
"The Organization taught in the best way how to deal with customers in Americas. How to be approachable, friendly and patient while dealing with customers. I am positive, this experience would certainly come in handy in my jobs here."
"the organization is the best to work with, and offers complete balance between personal and professional life. You enjoy salary benefits, bonuses, promotions on time and deserved get the opportunity."
"The organisation works progressively & highly collaborative and works closely in a Digital Environment. This nurtures a culture of cohesiveness and relationship building , which helps us to propel"
"The organisation praises you when you work accordingly. Great people, good management, everyone out there is helpful. You get to learn something new each day."
The organisation is customer friendly and as an employee you get an opportunity to learn alot.Overall its good to start your career with citifinancial
The organisation is a valuable name to start your career with. The environment is good enough and employees are provided ample chances to progress in their career.
The opportunities to learn are unlimited. 
"The only issue undergoing in this organization is low salary and rotational shifts. Apart from that it is a great workplace to explore your knowledge where we get all the support from the team management which helpd in the growth of individuals skills. Hi, thank you for your valuable feedback. Glad to hear that you are having a pleasant experience with HGS. We believe in providing industry standard of pay for all our employees. Please help us in understanding your concerns better, write to us at talk2us@teamhgs.com"
"the only good thing about infosys is, its onsite opportunities, apart from that the salary is quite low and the only increments are in the form of variables components."
"THE only criteria of growth is sale,and sale is propotional to service provided to customer. Excelent organization to learn the service industry.Employee benefits re also good .The best part is the HR deparment that provide safety to women and also gender equality in all terms."
The only best part about my journey with CTS was the exposure to start up a project. Did that for 2 projects & transitioned them successfully. It would have helped if management was more open to hearing employee suggestion and was not gender biased.
"The number of employees is too much, therefore the competition is high. Salary paid is not good enough. Work culture is good. Flexible job timings is a plus."
The most enjoyable part of job is late night work during finalization
"The most enjoyable part of job as we can get  two weekoff and govt holidays and paid leaves,comp off,stressfree,nice environment to work great embidance."
"The most difficult time during the job was the demonetization period. The employees where asked to work overtime with less free time. The management was very supportive and the customer interaction helped me to gain more knowledge about the attitude of different group of people.In my opinion, the toughest part of the job was sales within the cash counter. The account opening and sales of other products during the cash hours were difficult. I loved the job very much."
The most appropriated thing to say in Axis bank is that you will be learning everything that happens on the production floor. With new concepts and healthy discussions
"The Management, People are very supportive. We celebrate all Indian festival in a grand manner."
The management were extremely good and good working environment to work with. Learned new software technologies with the organisation. Participated in HR presentations gave me a new learning experience as well.
The management was very transparent. The shifts were decided as per the teams performance. I have learned a lot from AMEX. Learnt about how to manage people. Learnt to give feedbacks to team members.
"The management was very transparent and very clear with their objectives,with a right amount of mutual trust and respect.The co workers were supportive and cooperative as well.Well of course office timimgs were not a constraint due to work load.The most enjoyable part was that inspite of work load the job required one to be proactive,innovative and productive,hence the job was not monotonous kind of but was interesting and exciting."
The Management was poor but the work culture and knowledge gained was good. The experience obtained helps to improve yourself and to move on to further options in the future.
"The management of work flow and Man power management is not good. Changes are very quick and most important, choices are not there. We do not get freedom to select or change shifts/weekoff"
The management is very helpful to the trainees and provide with guidance and data for their projects. I did a short research project on Asset Liability Management in the day to day working of the Banks.
"The management is not at all supportive to employees. RMG, HR are supportive to management and Leads and not at all supportive to employees. RMG will map to the projects irrespective of employee technology or skills. If any better opportunity come to an employee the working project leads and  managers will not release you because they need to search for a new employee and train him."
The management is good. Work culture is very comfortable.
"The management is good and we have a good work culture,there is a good coordination among the staff, its a fun workplace with a good work life balance."
The main thing we need for this job is timing. we should check what product we needs to deliver if it is fragile then we should handle the product with more care.
The main part here is i gained more knowledge on ebooks and  product that made me to take a deep dive in more. giving day to day productivity and initiative.
The learning exposure and the corporate exposure was amazing and stimulating the thought process.
The job requires me to travel across globe and review the Citi processes in various geographies. The interaction with senior leadership helps a lot in learning the skills
"The job includes a lot of learning if you are a fresher. For experienced folks, career growth would become an issue once you exceed a certain tenure. Middle management is partial while the top is oblivious to the things that go around and are being done at lower levels.  Overall, the brand of Amazon may help you get better opportunities in future."
The job in Accenture is really nice to learn and grow in career. The people are helpful in my learning and also the managers are very supportive in teaching and making me to grow up the ladder of success.
"The job culture and the people were awesome. Talking to especially the nice people as well as customers made a day go by super quick. Also people were very willing to help. Hi, great to see your feedback :) Happy to hear that you are having enjoyable work experience with us. We wish you all the best for your career."
"The internal talent is not prioritized for growth, instead the talent is hired at very high cost from outside. This is more visible in APAC region. The policies and management is very different from North America"
The hidest part of the job.. It's important to me to have a job in HDFC bank and I m proud of me that I m working here so I can hard work with full security and no any mistake I can do please select me for this job I promise that I can hard work
"the HGS made my life style more competative, than my before. it gives me higher goals in my life. the work place make me to dream higher in my carear. Hi, thank you for your valuable feedback. Glad to hear you are having a pleasant experience with HGS. We wish you a successful career with HGS."
The hardest part of the job was to serve the customers with the best solutions and bring a smile on their face. The most wanted place where a person would love to work.
"The hardest part of the job in oracle is Quarter end & during this period, we have been asked to work 14hr which is very painful & not getting any allowance."
The hardest part of my job is to learn new technologies and adjust yourself for the upcoming assignments
"The Hardest part of my Job is anyway convincing my Clients for the solutions provided for there issues. Even if the issue is with the other relevant team, its difficult to make them understand how the process is, but this is returns helps us learn to handle most complicated issues with patience."
"The Growth is awesome for every employee. The company has good work culture, great environment, This is the best company to start a career in a corporate field. . Hi, thank you for your valuable feedback. We are happy to hear that you having a great work environment with HGS. Best wishes for your career ahead."
"The Growth is awesome for every employee and movement of process and position as per process requirement takes place. Training was good to employee to motivate Hi, Thank you for your review. Good to hear that you had a good experience with HGS. We wish you all the best in your future endeavors."
"The Growth is awesome for every employee and movement of process and position as per process requirement takes place. Training was good to employee to motivate Hi, thank you for taking the time to share your experience at HGS. We're so pleased to see that you enjoy working with us! At HGS, we're committed to providing quality training opportunities to our employees, in order to help them be the best at what they do. We're glad you recognize and value that as well. Good luck!"
"The greatest benefit of IBM is work from home or a staggered work day in terms of hours. A great place for work life balance but career advancement and compensation is the downside. As a team we shared great rapport but everyone lived in constant fear of the manager. They operate as stand alone units, no one questions them or their actions, which may or may not make sense or violate several policies. Assigning an internal HR would be helpful."
The good things
The good thing about the company is that it is well known and globally established brand but what makes this place a nightmare is the presence of large number of people who contribute negligibly to the company and due to their inefficiency at management level people at the lower levels suffer drastically leading to dis satisfaction and thereby leading them to look for other options.
"the good place to work nice place. HGS management & the colleagues are very cooperative, have learned many regarding the payroll profile, the working conditions are also very good & the workplace culture is good We appreciate your employment with HGS and we're glad that you enjoying working with us! We wish you all the best in your future endeavors."
"The Good place to work at , helps you to be on top of technology. With very friendly environment."
The flipkart is more leading company. Management was very good and managerial person was very easy to co-operate us and coulis also.
The firm keeps professionals enough challenged however work life balance is an issue these days with lot of folks!
"The experiences what I earned were good. It was my first job and taught me lot of things things like process knowledge, corporate culture, good behavior with people etc.."
The experience was great. The work culture was highly professional and respectable. 
The experience to big organisation will help you develop your personality and communication skills. Work environment is quite cool and relaxed. Work is mostly related to excel and powerpoint. It depends on the department but microsoft excel and powerpoint are basic. Work life balance is good
The Experience at Deloitte as been a very knowledge oriented one.
"The experience  have the value whereas skills and talent have no value in IBM, as well the growth is on the base on seniority even though that person is not working he has growth. The person can't raise their talent in front of seniors they will be make the shut down. Salary is very low compare to other companies, tenurity exceeds but no promotion's."
The environment is great. There is no pressure during normal shifts but only during peaks. The management is amazing and very supportive. The canteen on the first floor is huge and the casual environment will motivate you to work hard.
"The engagements are really good in deloitte, I got a lot tremendous exposure on the latest features of salesforce. Company's policy is good and but it lacks in management."
"The Duties are as follows:  •	Updated and maintained minute details of customers as. •	Responsible for maintaining CASA, Suivdha (Corporate Account), NRI, BBA, DEMAT accounts. •	Assisting customers for cash deposits and cash withdrawals and bill payments. •	Providing information to the customers regarding the Average Minimum balance (AMB)/ Minimum Relationship Value(MRV), reward points, debit card privileges. •	Providing information regarding rate of interest and opening of deposits such as Fixed Deposit, Recurring deposit, Senior Citizen deposit, Flexible deposit and  Tax Saver deposit.   •	Completing funds transfer requests such as transfers through RTGS, NEFT, IMPS or A2A •	Updating Standing instructions, Cheque issuance of CTS 2010, National Identification seeding, E-statement and mobile alert registration. •	Collecting relevant documents and following the set process defined. •	Recording all transactions correctly and in compliance with the bank guidelines.  •	Achieving targets by increasing sales and flow of debit card, credit cards issuance as well as internet banking, mobile banking, Demat and loans. •	Documentation and maintenance of records for closure of Accounts."
"The day when i troubleshooted the network by managing my higher officials.  Managing an issue, how to impart work with co-workers.  Management i worked with is very helpful and graceful to me.  My co-workers are good in coordinating work with each others..  Managing   Finding out the network error."
"The day usually starts with checking the previous day's audits, creating educational mailers, and appreciation mailers. The whole day goes in training or planning next training.  I got certified to take interviews for recruiting team. Daily interviews are fun. The people are great."
"The day starts with remote deliveries foe worldwide customer and have time to enjoy short breaks ,lunch. and may extend for delivery issues."
The day starts with everyone wishing well to each other. It's a very open and friendly working environment where people often have informal conversations. The leaders are very approachable and courteous. The entire team has their meals together willingly. There is no hardest or easiest part since it really depends on the type of work you get. Everyone has their good and bad days. 
"The day starts with checking emails and team sites for new requests/projects and then prioritising it before beginning to work.  It was a great learning experience in terms of building several skills, knowledge repository, multi tasking, learning leadership skills etc.  Management is quite friendly and has a open door policy.  Fun at work was the best part."
"The day starts at 08:00 am there. The employees are very supportive in nature. I learnt a lot things like dedicating all of you on the work with a balance between work and fun. I learnt the more efficient way of communicating with the customers. The workplace culture is far more than beautiful. There were people of different castes, religions, economic backgrounds, etc but when they used to gather, it looked like they are the same. The hardest part of the job was some irritating customers and the most enjoyable part was enjoying with the collegues."
"The day start with daily control check on operation, review and plan for the day and week. Rich exposure on operation, delivery, finance, quality, projects  Strong matrix organization, very well defined KPI aligned with strategic and tactical goal The hardest part of the job is when under normalization exercise you need to rate lower the best team member to fit the bell curve The most enjoyable  part of the job is to celebrate the success for each milestone and recap the improvement area"
the day of work was the sales team to report and after that take the follow ups of the customer from branch and convence the customer for personal loan.
"The day at work starts with a cup of coffee and a team meeting where the goals for the day are defined to every member of the team and precise targets were assigned. The management had given us all the freedom to work without monitoring us due to which we achieved our target way before the allotted time with 100% quality, which in turn gave us more time to come up with some creative and innovative ideas to improve the quality of service and help the other teams like the Business Development, Sales and Marketing. As we were working on the live website we had to maintain 100% quality but due to server problems and regular software updates there were incidence where we were forced to stop working and it was very disappointing as we did not want our customers to have any uncertainties. The management was highly cooperative and open for feedback. Due to excess work load there was a lot of stress at work, but our management was so cooperative that they put stress busters all over the bay like Foosball Table, Snooker Table and Ping Pong Table. They conduct learning and development secession twice a week which was very useful for us to come up with some new ideas, which in turn made us enjoy our work life. The best thing I learnt in this organization was, individual performance improved the team work and hard work of every team was the key to the success of the organization."
The Day at Capgemini is generally full of Enthusiasm.
The current role am into is pure sales. Full pressure but still we managed to have a work balance and enjoy our life at Citi. Wonderful Place to work.
The current project has made me learn many things like its a good place to learn but people cannot progress unless you either have relative at higher position or you keep on praising your seniors and keep them happy. Not sure about other BU's in the firm but have seen this since past 2+ years in current retail BU.
The culture of the company is wonderful and the work is great.it is difficult to notice the talent in a big mnc companies.apart from that everything is fine to work and the co-workers are amazing here.
The culture of company is Great Everyone worked with was amazing.
The culture in CTS is absolutely wonderful.They give you the space to work while catering to your career aspirations and the company gives options to move and try different roles and responsbilities
"The concern which provides all subsidiaries and benefits to it's employees and employers. The organization coordinate the projects and clients in a great manner to deliver and ensure SLA and TAT. Company follow the terms and conditions in a proper way to ensure the satisfaction and safety of the employees, employers and clients."
"The compulsory working hours was set to 9.5 hours a day, which according to me was very overwhelming. They should keep it to 8 hours a day, which can be managed easily by an individual."
"The compensation offered by the company is the worst part. Also, the working hours are on the higher side as well. However, I learnt a great deal of things since this was my first full time professional venture."
"The company's work environment is good it keeps the employees energetic. Rewards and Recognition programs encourages employees to continue doing the Great job by putting more and more efforts,new ideas and team triages helps in resolving most of the queries/concerns when it comes to software related issues."
The company work culture was full of learning and flexibility in working.
The Company with good knowledge and trained people. Every day is something you will taught. You ask and you get it. HSBC it is always in heart. Great Minds are always ready to help.
the company which i worked fast time i have learned many things of working nature&atmosphere good management my co workers are very friendly relationship begning of the job is very difficult to know the work process every day i enjoy with work and  with co-workers&superriors
"The company where i am working is having a good infrastructure. Staffs are supportive and approachable.Good working environment. And lots of fun and team work. Hi, thank you for sharing your review. Happy to hear that you are having a pleasant and good supportive people around you. We wish you a successful career with HGS."
"The company was very eager to give exposure to new candidates and supported them along the way.  The best experience i have while in Hgs is meeting different personalities. Hi, thank you for sharing your review. Happy to hear that you are having a pleasant and supportive people around you. We wish you a successful career with HGS."
"The company was good and well trained me in RTR general ledger .  i was taking care of month end activities , GL reconciliations , cash reporting, Balance sheet reconciliations."
The company recruits serious candidate who are willing to give their best for the organisation. The colleagues are also very helpful there. The atmosphere is very soothing to work.
"The company provided Good work environment suitable to employees. Health Benefits are provided. However, the company lacks in terma of salary and incentives Benefits which is the main reason Why people applied for a job position on the company.  We are working over time, but we did not receive enough compensation on it."
The company provide very good training on different mechanical software.
The company pays well and has good work environment as well. But the senior management and immediate bosses or leads are not supportive. 
The Company is well disciplined in terms of everything that they do. It runs on Good values. Management is supportive. Pay wise its a neutral company. Unlike other multinationals we dint get to see free meals. But recently IBM has introduced a free hot Beverages (Coffee OR Tea) which is a good move. Huge scope in terms of development skills.
The company is very good in every term. I learnt lots of new things in this company. I really have really good experience ever i had in life. I wish again i could be a part of this organisation.
"The company is very good i had great time in the company it was good working over there i enjoyed the work, i liked the people and location.i liked the shifts management"
"The company is very good as per the goodwill but the thing is salary matter. Other facilities is excellent like transport, accommodation etc. My experience is for management is not that much good as per we expect."
The Company is transitioning to a new Performance management model. This is why people are finding it difficult to understand the new perspective and having no clarity on what can be done to achieve new performance criteria.
The company is really good. The management is nice. I am satisfied with the work and management. Lot of learnings are there which improves our knowledge
"The Company is nice,the people are friendly but the growth is very Minimal.its a nice place to work i am looking for some thing which is big.I want  to further advance my studies"
The company is Innovation driven. They focus on Client value and upgradation of technology and people skills.
The company is good has a good brand in the industry.
THE company is good for growing both in career and also horizontally. Management is of mixed type.
The company is Good for freshers looking to train themselves in various technologies. But low salaries are an impediment. The culture is pretty good. though.
"The company is entirely workaholic, not at all employee concerned. Overall its 50-50 position.    Prefered only freshers with two years contract base with very less salary.   Considering the promotional part, its one of the fastest company."
The company is an amazing place to work. The best thing is that the organisation and does everything for the employees to maintain that work life balance.
The Company iis very competitive in the market and the shares are very high. Prodducts very flexible to the customer and having big potential of all asset product in the competitive market. Products very easy to sell the customer
The company has good work and life balance. The managers are supportive of your actions.
The company has good scope for freshers and initial growth for them is sure.
The company has a very good personal and work balance.
The company has a big setup & infrastructure & great past history. Good place if you work if you may survive as there are frequent changes in staff...
The company gives you good opportunities to learn new skills and honestly i still feel like a new joiner. However it has been over 5 years. I liked the employee oriented programs conducted as well as bench marking the potential contributors to create visibility and provide opportunities.
The company gave me chance to prove myself on managing larger team and provided sufficient knowledge and guidance to overcome any situation.
The Company doesnt need whether the Employee is happy or not the just go on for numbers productivity is the only thing they required may they loose many employees soon.
"The company doesn’t release an employee just because the process has ended, but will try to place you in a different process as per your skill. There is always job security"
The company concentrated on the growth of the employee as a whole. I enjoyed working in a company where there is work life balance.I was exposed to many new technologies.Had cooperative team.
"The company by itself is a motivation and it asks for a 120% of everything from an employee. Tremendous amount of learning in both analytical and people management. However, the lack of hands from the upper management into various departments gives it a bang. Absolutely 0% job security & lack of transparency."
The company & brand is good. The working environment is also good. The coordination between the the employees is also good. here I got the good knowledge within a very short time period.
"The Cognizant design team was an excellent learning experience. I had the chance to interact directly with clients of across verticals such as BFS, Health Care, Insurance, Retail. Cognizant also provided me an excellent learning opportunity  I had to relocate because of my partner's job location change."
the citi bank in India sees a great future but is not working hard enough to tap the market. the management just focuses on wealthy clients which are very  few in number. but is otherwise a good place to work in
"the brand is well known and pay is good, quality of management strongly depends on individual manager and can vary"
the brand is very reputed and so does it live....people working here definitely derive lots of confidence in their work and overall personality that it takes them quite ahead in their career goals
"The biggest positive about this company is having a nice campus. It is not just a tall building but a group of small buildings spread around a large area. Having garden, open air amphitheater, gymnasium, small fish ponds etc. etc. It looks refreshing while going out for a few minutes after continuous hours of work.  As far as working is concerned, it depends on the field and project you are getting into. An electronics engineering student might find it difficult to learn things at first whereas computer background students can enjoy working here. Not much of stress, flexible time shifts and friendly co workers."
"The best work life balance along with exposure to various technologies and various levels of Teams (Development, Testing, Support etc)."
The Best thing about oracle is the work - life balance. No work pressure at all.
"The best thing about Ericsson that each and every employee would brag about is the vast number of opportunities that the company provides to its employees. The Ericsson Technical Certification Programme has courses for all levels of employees, from freshers to top level managers. Especially being a fresher, I found the learning materials in the Ericsson Learning website and ALEX (Active Library Explorer - A tool that contains all things you need to know about the hardware and its optimization and integration) very helpful for me to bridge the gap between my textbook knowledge and what actually was happening in the industry. The second best thing I like about E// is the way it treats its employees. A fresher would get the same respect and warmth as any other experienced employee in the company. The experienced employees are also readily available for young techies to share their knowledge and help resolve issues. But some times the workload might get too high. Ericsson has got some stress busting activities like table tennis, carrom, chess and has got a coffee place (free!!) with newspapers for its employees. With the recent modification in the top level management, I could see a very well structured hierarchy and felt its effectiveness eventually. Overall its the ideal place for an employee, especially for those starting their careers."
The best place to work. Fun environment despite job being challenging. You will look forward to going to work each new day. Fabulous management and very people centric. Job security is guaranteed.
"The Best place to work with completely balanced life. Attractive incentives, annual functions and many other activities on the floor to balance fun and work ratio."
The best place to work nd to earn 
The best place to work as well as Learn. Fun to work in this team. Good and well understanding management. Awesome work culture. Nothing makes me hard in this team to talk. Team outing's and IBM's Work from Home are most convenient and enjoyable part of the Job.
The best place to learn new technologies for freshers without any pressure.
The best part of the office is your team and it can also be the worst part.
The best part of the job was the co-workers who were all a bunch of fun loving yet highly capable people who were willing to guide and assist you and would also praise you if you delivered excellent work. I got a lot more adapted to SEO guidelines and became more comfortable writing for websites. The management were also highly supportive though they started insisting on increasing the quantity of work even when the quality of work was deteriorating among the employees.

"Since I was promoted to the manager position last year, there has been a sharp increase in sales—particularly over the last two quarters. Our conversion rate hasn’t dipped below 70 percent, and we’ve met segment goals in each department 80 percent of the time, which is the highest percentage in our region."
"Since I was employed for a long period with Axis Bank Ltd, I have varied experience.  Initially,  when I had not started a family,  I got promoted.  But,  when I started my family, it be became difficult for me to maintain work -life balance thereby I was compelled to take a sabbatical.  Now that my child is grown up, I want to resume working.

Service based without there own product. Always yes men  for clients never propose any technical changes. Poor team structure. Managers are not able to nuture team members effectively.
Seriously a bitter company to work at... Too much of politics and bias. People don't consider talent. They seek how u pat and praise and worship our managers. People really attracted towards the brand name... Nothing here. Too much micro management... People don't consider talents people who pet the managers get better band and promotion.... People who question the superior are released or given worst bands....  No work life balance....

"Self learning is required. If you don't come out of your comfort level, then you will stay stagnant in your current role. Long term resources are not compensated on par with lateral resources. Only up side is onsite opportunities, but it is drying up as most of the clients prefer to have a lean onsite presence."
Seeking a challenging and rewarding opportunity with an organization of repute which recognizes and utilizes my true potential while nurturing my analytical and technical skills.

"Positive planning, responsibility and flexible any working condition.  Take initiative and have good leadership qualities."
"Poor Management not ethical -no work balance internal politics, unethical HR policies bad management not employee friendly no job security bad reputation"
Poor management and no job security ...no process at all....no work life balance...long duty hours....promotions after 10 years...overall no management control over the processes
"Policies are pretty strict, work culture is decent enough but being such a big organisation, best part was to meet people from such diversity of cultures and different parts of India."
"Policies are good,Manages well performed architects and number of clients..management is not so good in hearing the experience people lot more changes be done"
"Plenty of work life balance, but moving up the ladder is difficult.. very unstructed format of work.. in last year increment cycle has been delayed.. no uniform policy across organisation"
Pleasant Work Environment.Good place to start the career.
Planning daily task in every morning meeting was helped every team and team members work load. More workload moulded me in handling a difficult situation in a smart way and complete the deliverable in a successful way.
Place to learn new technologies. Great opportunity to build career.
"Place to learn and grow having good team bonding, increase interest towards work management make fun work environment and opportunities.Everyday is special, first and last week are awesome."
"Place offered variety of roles & responsibilities. However, role orientation was somehow flawed. There was a considerable difference between the job profile I was offered at the time of interview and what was eventually provided at the time of joining."
Person's talent is not noticed . More competition.As a fresher it's really a nice organization to be with.
Personally I learnt a lot from the organisation as well as this is a transparent organisation who gave equal opportunity to all for growth. Seniors are helpful and supportive
"Personally i feel you this company provides you a very good platform where you can manage your work life balance. But still i believe,  learning is very minimal."
Personally and professionally it's a good company but on long run salary hikes and work culture are not good.
Perfect work life balance
"Perfect work environment , One of the best management, salary wise good , Suitable facilities and perks..etc."
Perfect place to learn professionalism and get exposed to a diverse work environment.
"People work in hdfc bank are for only sale,no work life balance.Mad management increment and bonus on basis of your skill..Rest go and try on your own.Thanks"

People were very helpful when i was new to this whole field. I learned new things as how online companies work especially in apparel sector.
"People very apprehensive to join Deloitte India, and existing employees feel the pressure, since there is no work-life balance, and no recognition by the management of the same"
"People Management, Account Management , Sales & Revenue Recognition, Strategic Planning, New Business Development, Customer Retention, Sales Forecasting, Market Research & Analysis, Partner Relations, Marketing, Negotiation, Budgeting & Compensation Partner Relations, Performance Management, Team Building, Customer Relations Development"
People Management
People in high hierarchy harass new join. Not a good place to work. No work appreciation. Never encourage and always insult in front of other employees
People demonstrate winning culture through positive and meaningful relationships.
"People Centric,  Gives opportunity to grow and values feedback. Always felt free to walk up to the Manager in case of concerns.  Open dependable and connected."
People always worry about what next if the current project completes.
Peacefuul atmosphere Bad manager thats why changing company and preference for state people oly importance to northy
"peaceful n cooperative work culture, typically days are very smooth and changed alot in last 6-7 years in positive way n changing more day by day to adjust with present time."
Pathetic management and transport. High attrition rate. Lack of motivation for employees to work better. Work environment is not good.One of the greatest advantages is that there are lot of processes or engagements to switch between. So Job security is good.
parsality based management
"Owsome....fun in big billion day 6 October, great time with my Co worker Yogesh n sumit"
"Overall,its a very good company that can be engaged with.But has an average pay scale which is very disappointing .It allows employees to explore the learning opportunities and drives a good performance"
"Overall, it was a good experience. I got to learn a lot about customer service. The pay and the perks are best in the marketplace. Work place is dynamic. Most managers are friendly. Cons- Employees have no control over their shift schedules."
"Overall, good journey. Learned lot of new things. My journey here started 08 years back in F&A world and since then I have been associated with AMEX."
"Overall you will get to learn banking but no work life balance. Growth depends upon how much sales target you are achieving which is the worst part, you will not get any development opportunities for your hard work in operational field. Apart from that if you are lucky enough then you will get the help of other employees or else they will back stab you. Salary in this industry is pretty well as for beginners. My experience working with the bank was pretty good & I'll always be thankful to the bank for giving me the opportunity to be the part."
Overall you can work here for good 2 years to build your career. Its a good plave for people looking for growth and stability. Not the best in terms of money.

"Overall satisfaction has been achieved in this esteemed organisation, great opportunity for who learn and take up challenges. Worth working in this organisation."
"Overall okay, it is a huge ocean of opportunity but the only con is the salary and benefits are not up to the mark. You can still consider this platform"
Overall ok..I can not say is good for work because we all are depending to totally government bank for life insurance business to achieve are target।  .
Overall not much satisfied with salary hike 
Overall not a very satisfactory experience in terms of appraisals and work culture
"Overall nice experience. Comfortable working environment.It is a commonly known fact that if one person is feeling down, they bring everyone else down with them. Negativity is contagious, and it can have a detrimental effect on the workplace. Not only does a negative environment cause employees to be unhappy with their jobs, but it makes them less productive.Im just looking for recommendations of other operating systems which would be suitable for the task."
overall nice experience at HGS. training was very effective. get a chance to learn and upgrade your skills. sometime the shift timings gets extended. everything is fine We appreciate your employment with HGS and we're glad that you are enjoying the work with us!

Overall its a good company to work and learn. Pampering is more here and lots of politics among staffs.Partiality..gender feelings r there in between company..
"overall it was not a pleasurable work,mismanaged,no work life balance lesser growth lesser salary"
"Over-all it was a good learning experience to work in this company. I learned many new things. Management encourages to learn new things but then you hardly get free time to explore them. Work life balance was good. Work From Home was not an issue there.  Team collaboration was lesser in my team. Not everyone was so keen in taking up responsibilities.   But all-in all, it was a good experience for me."
Overall it is good experience working with the company. Company policies are good and few things should improve regarding management.
Overall infosys is a great place to work and grow in career. Management is amazing. However when it comes to work the environment is result oriented due to which the work pressure is more. The person who is able to perform accordingly will be able to grow fast enough. The perks and benefits provided are amazing be it directly from the company or from the clients. Appreciations are regular for the deserving candidates.
Overall I think Amazon is a pretty good company to work for. I feel like they really try to make sure they are being inclusive and have a diverse workforce

Overall good in learning banking culture and good team building activities.program for enhancing our banking knowledge
"Overall good for quick learners, and the management is friendly and helps you with everything once you are part of the company.  Your discipline at work pays you dividends."
"Overall good Experience working with the company, Learned aswell as developed new skills.But Experienced manager working with great skills Growth is very slow"
Overall good experience from beginning till now.  This company gave me a career which I was looking for. In the year 2011 I started as customer service executive and now working as Assistant manager in operations.
overall good experience but not my type ...company atmospher is too rude..no corporations is there ..salary is on time..it's good .dinner and lunch will be provided by the company but the food is not so good ..10hours working job ..productivity is good ..
Overall good experience and great work culture.
Overall good experience
Overall good co. to work with. However need to focus on giving the employees a challenging role. Work depends on the contacts you have and how much time you have spend in the bank
"Overall good bank , good work environment, main pressure not on banking operations but on selling life insurance and other third party products.  All depends upon the bm....How he downloads the pressure"
Overall experience is excellent with ample learning opportunities for freshers. Excellent work life balance. Managment support is also good in terms of new initiatives.
Overall company culture is good. You get a chance to work on different role. Salary is at par with industry. Office infrastructure is below par. Working between teams an be difficult.
Overall Axis Bank is very good place to work and high appreciation by management for business.
Overall average work culture where you can manage your personal and work life well. But salary and other benefits are not sufficient to survive in this century.
Overall an average organisation in terms of Employee relations. Very dynamic and fast moving organisation in terms of Business prospects. Performance at any cost is the key to success

"Our profile as a Customer Care Professional includes rotational shifts which is applied each month. The job has back to back calling where we handle International card members (Credit Cards) and it is the best customer service provided in the world as i would say. It is an 8 hour shift with suitable breaks in between as well as daily monitoring of calls and weekly feedbacks and team huddles included. This Job, barring the rotational shifts and back to back calling is a great job, American Express is teh 4th Best company in India and the 3rd best Company for woman in the world. Work culture is perhaps the best. People here are motivated to be their creative best and deliver the best as well. Compared to others the work pressure is lesser, the work environment is chilled and Leaders are amazing.  The only reason why i have to leave this company is because of my family. My mother lives all alone with my granny and i feel my presence is required there than in anywhere else"

"On floor things will be rosy , but your colleagues at your lever have to compete with each other so they will have all rosy pictures for their managers and super managers. If you move a needle also in any of the process , send email , communicate and celebrate as if you have done a Event of the year. If you can do this along with your manager acknowledgement you will be on the top of notice and have a long journey. You may on top for a year but you may fall in the bottom once your manager changes and just because they will not have a reason. If you can get your manager impressed you can grow in the org. This is just the truth about A____. Know that once you are cornered , ensure that you take influence help and move out of the skill and move to another skill."

Now a days banking industry is growing sector and i will like to grow with it with my job honor and hard work i would like to join banking or accounting jobs in UAE.
nothing to say much about the company.And if we work hard there is no future for us those who doesnt work here have the future over here. I work here but i should not speak like this but the fact that i am speaking regarding this is real.Work culture is also worst here
Nothing to say in specific. It was a good journey in cognizant as a developer.  I had good career advancement. Had good opportunity to learn new technologies
Nothing same came there as process change and was taken to different team.
Nothing much.  Depends where and which department we join in amazon.not all the departments are like that. I felt non tech have become too much of micromanaging. And too much of pressure without recognizing of an idividual
Nothing Much to learn
"Nothing like flipkart as a workplace. Good environment, friendly surrounding, approachable management.  The very first E-Commerce with max number of sellers. 5 days of working Taught team management, Multitasking, ERP Module, and offered few courses like LEAN  Extra curriculum activities were the best part."
"Not very interesting job, zero learning, managers are dumb, friendly co-workers, every part of the job is hard to cope with and there is nothing to enjoy."
"not very fun to work with amazon as they used to make u do overtimes despite the employees will. employees weren't treated good, policies of amazon ws in a such a wa that it felt likemit was against its employees"
"Not very easy to switch between teams and take a different career track. However, considering the work life balance the company gives it is definitely worth settling down in."
Not so good for fresher as they have to sit on bench for more than 6 months. People have manager employee attitude. work culture is not so good. But one can take opportunity for starting career if no other option is available
Not so bad nothing to say  about the company its just I was there for 6 months. Work capture is good but the management is not that good. There is no freedom to speak
Not satisfied with the sales job.
Not much of Stress of the employees
"Not much of career growth. Management less in contact with the juinors. Good coordintion, less hike, lower competitive salary. Good work life balance."
"Not much career progression , internal politics are ruining everything , all good performers usually leave , hikes are extremely low , and few years had no hike despite good ratings , not for a long time alliance"
"Not many challenges, not enough authority given to the Managers. Its a little disappointing to sit there and not do enough since there are not many opportunities."
"Not happy with the work enviornment and management.Highly unorganised management in case of HR,and Admin.Had no motivation to work properly as there was no approprite Management who would appoint responsible manager to take care of business."
Not good company to work. Typical indian labor supplier. making engineeries as labors. only status but no knowledge. worthless worthless. management ois media frenzy only.
Not good company in terms work which needs to be done.
Not good and no security for the job.. No good learning and trainings provided
"not comfortable with my boss, no salary hike for the last two years"
Not bad. You can get help from the colleagues. Seniors are supportive someyimes. Management is  unreachable. Management never try to solce or understand the problems of employee.
Not at all profitable  for BCA graduate. Work category is same as other destination  like PA and associate but salary is less. You do not have choice to switch to your preferable domain or technology.
Not at all approachable for staff to hirarachy for personal issues  biased approach towards employees.
"Not an awesome place for freshers as you are given the waste works which basically involves helping the management.  Self growth is just nil, if you need to learn learn by yourself."
Not addressing all talents.. restricted to budget.. no proper management of resources.. Dominance..no new technology implementation.. no good opportunities
Not a very good place for entry level. One good thing they push you for Certification.
Not a great place to work and lot of pressure on doing sales. Work life balance was too low and a long working hours. Hardest part of the job was doing sales alone with operations
"Not a great company to grow. Management is not that bad, but not that good too. You have to work like a donkey out there.Life is great there if you are not ambitious."
Not a good process and management plus no benefits given to the employer
"not a good place to work as no proper training program. appraisal is next to none, if you are thinking of moving up in your career and promotion within the organisation please avoid working here"
not a good place to work as a contract employee
Not a good place for experienced and some one serious in life.good for part time job.if you are a fresher just spent sometime it's okay but not for people who want to build a career.
Not a best company if you want to explore opportunities. Its not a best company to work of you are a functional person. The management is fine. No complaints
"Normally your day would start with not too much work but then work gradually goes on increasing. People I worked with were extremely helpful and qualified so, overall a best place to work in."
"Normal Good morning .. sometimes fun .. sometimes boring  .. well balanced though,get yo learn a lot of things from the managers, the way the speak and mostly when we take calls .. the person at the other end is in trouble coz his internet is not working.. and that's worst than anything for them so we help them understand the problem and find a solution as we speak the hardest part of the job is the working hours which is 10 hrs. The enjoyable part of my job is get to learn more technical things sometimes my more friends less  colleagues."
Non stop Picking Up calls in 9 hours duty. good atmosphere in floor. every one i supporting over in bridge. mostly team leaders or good. and training provided is very good We appreciate your employment with HGS. We are glad that you had a good working experience with us. We wish you all success in your future endeavors.
no work like balance
No work life balance. High work pressure. Job insecurity. Extreme humiliation at work. No dignity of labour. not solution oriented. More escalation oriented
No transparency in climbing up the ladder and reviews related to hike not explained. 
"no support system, self centric work culture, no belief in customer service just thinking of self target achievement only, have to invest time and energy after small things and no support from central admin team"
No support from Management .

"No proper work life, No employee friendly but Manager friendly company. Pay hike standard is worst. No Hikes, No growth. Job safety depends if you are close to Management else worst."
No place for learning
No perks and benifits for employees at all. No increments. You have to curb for the promotions. So much bios culture. If you want to grow then this is not the place to work
No other IT company can match Infosys in terms of employee facilities. The emphasis on training and continuous learning can be leveraged to reskill yourself. Work wise it is similar to other IT companies in India.
No much career growth. Lack of learning new Technologies.
No more hard days for me in my career
"No issues with In and out Time untill and unless you any meetings lined up. since it was my first exposure in Industry, learnt alot how to tackle issues in professional world. Overall was a good Exp. and work is more Fun in there"

"No heat to new ideas, lot of company resources wasted on redundant work. Workplace atmosphere is very poor. Management does not know their subject themselves."
No good relationship in the bank. So was not happy for the job. So wNted to move I can grow the work culture was like stagnant water  so wanted a change
No free time to think about your career.Just work work work and work. No job security. They will ask you to leave without any prior notice and give you 3 month basic salary
no fixed timings
"No employee benifit policy. Timing is horrible and mandate of daily slog hours, all driven by internal politics and not scope for self review or improvement."
"No employee benefits, hard and smart worker is not rewarded always, There is no proper guidance for work, All are no treated equally. Appraisals are not based on performance."
No defined set of target what one do is always expected for more to sales lots of pressure to sale third party Products LI on which no incentives are received..
"No comparison of any office with Amazon.  It is the best.  The work culture,the ethics,the enjoyment,the love,the colleagues ,the timely celebrations ... Amazon is Heaven"

"My work at American Express invovlved working on pending applications for credit cards which revolved around verification and decisioning of the application.I was to talk to the applicant verify the details and inform them about the decision on the applicatiopn for the American Express credit card they applied for.American Express has one of the most efficient managements with a fun filled environment helping you grow and nurture in an exciting way,"
"My typical day starts with looking up fresh candidates for screening and interacting with managers to discuss. Learned a lot in regards to stakehlder management, understand business. My coworkers are always ready to help. The management has been cooperative in providing me with the tools to work."
"My typical day starts with a call with the onsite team early in the morning and over the call we plan our work, discuss the timelines, clear doubts, share knowledge etc. Deloitte gives ample opportunities and flexibility to choose our career path and develop our-self. Management is very transparent,helpful and takes good care of the employees. Everyone is provided with a good medical care program, we also have sabbatical programme, then female employees are provided long maternity leaves and extra allowances . Deloitte believes in diversity and here we can find workers from various communities and background. But here in office even though we have cultural ,language and other differences, we are all united by the business, the project and  most importantly by the common goal that we all share. The hardest part of the Job would be working with the team at onsite i.e US. Because of the timezone differences we have to attend calls early in the morning and late at night  too and this sometimes affects our work life balance. Another challenge is to understand the clients need. The offshore hardly interacts with the client and all the information and updates come from the onsite team and therefore some information are misinterpreted, some misunderstood and some missed out on its way to us.  The most enjoyable part is the 30 days paid holiday that employees are given each year and plus 10 days public holiday in a year. We also have enough of events and programs to keep the spirits high on the floor."
"My typical day at work starts with checking priority related work and going through the mailboxes which I handle. I have learned a lot of things in Deloitte like time management, learning new courses. Management is excellent and very supportive of your ideas. My co-workers are very friendly and helpful. Hardest part: In my view there is no hardest part. You need to dig deep to research and find the solution and that is where it is very enjoyable and satisfying part of any job."
"My tenure at Oracle has been very successful. The company provides employees with world class training, opportunities to grow and for the sales team - sky is the limit to earn your compensation.  The quality of employees here is excellent. People from different backgrounds with immense knowledge and above all smart."
My team 's profile is unique as it is a blend of core operations and customer service operations. Hence there is a lot of scope for adding value to the job I perform. My day typically begins with understanding the volume inventory followed by the priorities for the day. Handling stakeholders and looking into client transactions that require my attention. I have a quick catch up with my Manager and my peers as we constantly exchange ideas and share views on topics that could help us share best practices. I spend a lot of time with my team members in coaching them. This is the most enjoyable part in my day as it helps me groom individuals future leaders. I constantly challenge my team to deliver beyond their potential to help them realize their endeavors.

"My role as as a part of the Complex Booking Team starts with performing Quality Checks on the Complex/High Value transactions.  The primary activity is to analyse and prepare reports relating to Input  Quality , Turn Around Time and dashboards which were to be shared with the middle management."
my review is that people spend almost full day in office....leaving btheir kids and family....they should also consider employees genuine problems.Too much of stress gives poor performance at work.
"My Review is limited strictly to my Process, I have no much idea about the other process in Concentrix.  It is my First company and is indeed a great organization to start your career with. I learnt what coroprate is....business etiquettes,escalations, feedback sharing, E-mails, client servicing and many more.   Additionally I became extremely Adabtable and more fluent in English especially when handling UK clients.  Transport facility is Average.Management is also good... Ops, Training, V&As, quality, WFM etc.   However there is a room for improvement in the rationality factor. Instead of having a practical approach and discussing it with clients, SOPs are blindly adhered to irrelevant of the consequences and quality or training doesnot help much.  Rest all good...."

The compensation and benefits kept me focused on achieving my targets and the friendly nature of the management team and my team mates made my workplace enjoyable. I learned to effectively  co coordinate and work with teams located in different geographies. Oracle has excellent sales and technology training programs that helped me control my conversation with customers and enhanced my knowledge about Oracle technology products.Building and maintaining business relationships with the Federal Agencies of another country was a huge task and this required a lot of research of the accounts assigned to me and interaction with people who were experienced in the said job. This process helped me learn a whole new perspective to technology sales. The quarter end team kick off gatherings were great fun that enabled a energised start for a fresh new quarter.The overall the exposure made me grow my skills to interact better with existing and new customers and represent my company with confidence and pride."

My first and best company which had taught me skills in the most perfect way and potrayed  great working culture. Happy to be associated with Accenture again.
"My experince working in DELL has been the best so far. Great Team manager encouraging us regularly. I was in Pilot project. We never mind doing doing OT too, as the organization took good care of our pay and work life balance."
My experience was good .having friends and benefits for health was added advantage . Will be interested to work in such environment . Will be missing those fun. But work was so interesting and worth doing . Great benefits where provided .
My experience was better but some problems to left job. Good environment in work area 
"My experience was below average here. Learnt to work on project all by myself, management was unfriendly and non - supportive. Work life balance was not good. No extra pay for working on weekends."
My experience is very good.it is all day shift including three breaks.i m one of the top performer.work environment is good with supporting staff.the most enjoyable part when i resolved my customers query.
My experience is good so far but  the kind of the job has become quiet monotonous wherein I am quenching for some new learning
"My experience in Deloitte is unmeasurable. I always would like to work with deloitte, as I get used to those Internal control systems with deloitte as i started my career with Deloitte."
"My experience in Accenture -The place place to work, wonder people, lot to learn.Felt like home. Any day given a change would like to join back the team."
"My experience has improved working here at Accenture  it has taught me confidence,management of work and time and made me a strong human being but hope for the growth financially and professionally hence wants to try for more ..."
"My experience at Amazon taught me a lot in a very short span of time. I took away with me skills like prompt decision making, understanding people, etc."
"My experiance with this company is nice, the workplace culture over here with all my other employee is worth appreciating. I got to learn more from my senior and with my colic they are always be their with me whenever i have requirement of their help. Great to hear that you enjoying working with us. Happy to have an employee like you working with us. We wish you a successful career with HGS."
"My day to day Job involves giving support to Desktop and Laptop users. Creating users in Active Directory, reset password, disable accounts, renew user accounts etc., Configuring outlook email, create PST's, map PST's.etc.,"
"My day starts of with opening the batch and handling the branch operations. It was very challenging and also interesting. I learned numerous financial and banking terms and processes invloving, KYC AML, Investment banking, Forex and Trade and also Vendor Management. The management is very much supportive only sales wise. Workplace culture was very fine, friendly environment. The hardest part of the job was the timing. I know sometimes it would take to extend the working time to finish the job and I'm very much supportive with that but this happening in a regular basis for no reason was a very hard thing for me adapt in and also the hardest part goes with the CTC. I would be happy if I were paid for late sitting on a daily basis. The most enjoyable part of the organization was the day shift and even weekend holidays."
"My day starts around 11 AM. Basically I start my day with networking/socializing for about 30min and then will start my work. Checking my to do list for the day and acting on it. Will try to finish off my work for the day as I planned and will also try to accommodate any other work in between which need my attention on that day itself. I also provide my guidance to my team members and help them in resolving the issues raised during the work. While I work on any task, basically I look and try to complete that work on efficient manner and also try to do some research to see if I could add more value to the work that I am doing."
"My day at office starts with Scrum meeting, where we will discuss and decide who works on what based on priorities of that iteration. As the day progresses, if tasks assigned are finished we are free to choose tasks from pool.   Very friendly work environment, filled with talented people with proven expertise in varying skill sets.  Hardest pat of job is promotions which are decided by higher management driven, but driven by varying HR policies from cycle to cycle. It's kind of non-transparent, independent of experience and expertise.  Flexibility is definitely best part of the job."
"My Co-Workers are very nice. We work as a team. I enjoy every Moment i pass in the office. Management are so helpful. i have learned lot of things such as Excel, Team handling etc."

I've learned many things from flipkart which helps me to improve my self  in profession an personal life also.  Excellent Staff they like my 2nd Family.   The hardest part of the job is to take the decision to leave flipkart i guess the worst decision ever taken by me.  The Most enjoyable part of my job was combo of fun an pressure which i've faced in flipkart."
My 11 years at Axis Bank has taught me a lot...good bad and the ugly.A typical day starts at 9 am and ends at 8 pm...the workplace culture is ok.....the hardest part of the job.....sacrifice family life for your job and then not get rewarded...on top of that seeing less deserving people getting rewarded.
Multiple technologies available to choose for working
Multiple opportunity to learn and groom ourselves as a professional in the field we are interested in. Job security is 100%. Average Work Load is a bit more on the employees.

"motivated,guides me how to work even under pressure.hdfc bank gives me lot of things.change my whole life style,my way of talking and many more.and i really thankful for this."
Mostly involved in maintenance projects. I worked for British Telecom. All in all somewhere between average and good. Not so employee friendly i would say.
Mostly i work as a tax consultant for US Clients .we received the provided documents by clients and create the work paper and file return for them. 
Most of the project are support projects so if you like to get into R&D please try somewhere else other than that it provide a stable job and good work life balance. The management is a bit slow and the HR is of no use. The business processes are too much networked so the person to contact or the workflow for any process is not clear. On the whole if you want a stable job it is a good place to work at.
"most of the employee stick to oracle due to NSA night shift allowance, which is 25% of your Net Sal."
most enjoyable part of the job and i like my some custmore beacause of they build good realetion with me..
More than bearable focus on business which distracts people from being compliant and honest. Of late the bank is facing lots of criticism for lack of focus on compliance and being too annoying in pushing customers for business.

Handling escalated calls relating to customer queries and resolving disputes over the phone. Got the first-hand experience of dealing with corporate clients in the USA (i.e., AT&T, Motorola, Microsoft, IBM). Everything on the shop floor is operated with clockwork precision. In fact, it is the most organised workplace I have been to thus far. I met some of the most friendly and hard working people. The long working hours and the constant revision of target to be achieved were quite a challenge. However, at the end of the day, you feel proud and satisfied to complete your task."
"Monday was the typical day to work on task I have learned a many more things about DBA work place is supportive hardest part was to work on Troubleshooting  Sunday is always enjoyable for me, where we all set get together plans"
Moderation process is biased. Top Management are not good. Projects work life balance varies project to project. growth within organisation are not likely for all employee due to biased process.
"Meeting Customer Production Target Daily basis Review daily production meeting with achievement with down time analysis Preparing Weekly KPI and review with team, and make a continuous improvement plan to meet the KPI Enable and employee engagement through SIX SIGMA  activities, KAIZEN's, 5's audits."

Management skills are well developed with good over gain on technical front.
Management should improve. Also there should be more projects under Capgemini. Work life should improve as well because people are not friendly enough.
"Management process is very slow, working with old technology ,Good number of holidays, deployment process involves too much approval and review process at end of year is very complex"
Management plays an vital role for Sustainability of organization and self sustainability. And good management lead the organization towards the growth and helps in achieving the organisational goal and vice versa. If you see that the organization is at stagnant level then it means the management of such organisation is not efficient. Further more to speak on organisation is an ability to handle the and manage any kind of situation in an best possible ways.
Management lacks vision and does not take into consideration the long time benefits of any strategy. HR is totally mislligned to the company's value and brand.
Management is very supportive and introduces new and improved process improvements to reduce the pressure. Peers are also very helpful to each other. People co-ordinate with each other which makes working fun even though work pressure is present.
management is very good.hardest part of job in rainy sessions.
"Management is very friendly, not to feel pressurized at work just enjoying the work, co-workers very supportive, feel great to work at any place."

Management is really keen on educating you and helping employees advance to better roles. Coworkers are helpful and willing to train new employees to take the team to a better level.
Management is really bad in our process. Otherwise it's good. Management doesn't evn care if u are into what shift. They jus want you to work. They evn throw you into another u experienced process if they are less people without evn your convent and without informing the HR. Food is not good as usual. Breaks were fine before n now it's worst. Ppl love to quit hsbc these days. Hike and bonus is a good thing in hsbc. Team leads r good. No OT. If required you LL have to extend as usual and u get the pay for OT. NSA  as per your shift. Overall the experience is okay okay kind. Management infact became worst from past 6-7 months. Else it was really very good to work at hsbc.
Management is poor. All boot licking people gets promoted. If you resign then you will get retained by 2 digit hike other wise you will not get hike or promotion. If your manager wants you can own the company. You don't have to do any work. Just sit and be manager. 
Management is not good. Culture is not good. Product and Services Quality are not upto the mark. Work Facilities are quite less. Changing Vertical is very difficult
management is great

"Management inconsistencies, hire and fire environment. No distinctive roadmap to visualise growth. No career plans in place for the prospective talent to grow and nurture."
Management focus on individual competencies and monetary growth. If there is medical problem they have doctors available and nurse available 24/7 and 365 days.
Management and people were good in my first team at the end the higher ups with my HR were bias and rude  it's more into banking and best place to work they teach you way to work the training environment with perks are good

No requirement in the IT market. Then again got trained in another leagcy technology CA Plex which is a actually a developing tool. No company uses this. So after two years you will be ending up learning absolutely nothing. They just take freshers in bulk and trains them in a technology that no other experience associate will take up.  Not Employee Friendly- I interacted with my HR and my manager for a transfer to Kolkata Capgemini for a medical issue. Provided them all sort of documents whatever they have asked for, even I shared the seriousness of the state but they simply don't bother, they just think about their own. They kept on getting away from the matter.They simply played around with me in my tough condition.  Salary - Horrible No hike, for 1 year absolutely horrible.  Work Environment - Worse.  Development - Negative growth.  Conclusion: Not a good company for the freshers to start off their career less options zero development, years old technologies."

It good's place to work if you want to balance your personal and professional growth. Reason if you are looking for long term career in that case you will have to forget about your career growth as per market standard.

In my experience  it has been a fun workplace.  You get ample room to grow and gain new skills.  Although the monetary benefits are not as you'd expect.  Yearly monetary benefits are bare minimum.
"In my career of about 3 years with Axis, I have handled different products. Apart from scrutinising through each document, my job required me to enhance my communication skills since I daily got to interact with large corporates.

I'm here for last 2 years. Work life balance and culture is very good. But feeling that salary is very less than other companies in race. Nothing free here. Even pantry coffee machines are not good.
I'm an early bird. I get up every morning and jog before breakfast.
I'll never forget my team. Woke gets a little times hectic but manageable. . Let's how to get flexible with timing. . The best thing about Citi was there was fun everywhere and we could have a great communication and build a wrap o will people around
"If you're having trouble deciding whether your friend is a true friend, then your relationship is already on the rocks. Friends are a dime a dozen, but true friends are something far rarer, and far more rewarding. Luckily, they're also easy to spot."
If you're fine with less pay and moderate level of job security then Infosys is for you. All Campus is really good with various facilities such as dormitory for sleeping swimming pool gym etc
"If your project/unit/team demands a good amount of work and you are responsible person who can not let the work incomplete then trust me you are screwed, your work life balance will be in trouble, you cannot leverage the facilities/recreational ooportuniti provided by Infosys unless it is a weekend.   There are even projects where there is literally no work and people enjoy it.   There are a lot of certifications available and a very good and organized e-learning platform to benefit from.  Like every other company, top management makes huge amount of money and the lower hierarchy keeps on struggling.  There is relaxation of dress code, you can dress in presentable formals or casuals."
"If you want, you can have work life balance. Working on fairly old technologies. No innovative work in terms of latest technologies. If you work hard you will get good appraisals. Management is not good. No motivations from seniors."
If you want to settle in your life want to stay for longtime. Capgemini is one among them subjected if you dont expect hike.
"If you want to learn and learn and grow then Infosys is the your company. Apart from Salary, you will get everything, exposure to corporate world, New opportunities and many more"
"If you wanna learn lot many things in short period, then go for Capgemini... There is lot of scope for beginners and learners.."
"If you wanna be a FMCG sales guy then axis is the best place for you. You need to sell everything except banking products. And to top up the pressure the targets or the focus of the day keeps changing on an hourly basis. A baseline employee is always confused. The branch head may ask for life Insurance, cluster head for mutual fund, circle head for otr, rdh for retail assets, head distribution for casa...The pace at which the bank has grown in the recent years is commendable but the level of service to both internal and external.customets have gone.down."
If you need Work life balance then please do choose Citi. Citi will give you lot of opportunity to grow in your career and the management will really appreciate the efforts that you take.
If you like to take your life in a slow but steady path this is the company you should get to. Its a team based company and just takes good care of all employees.
"if you get the right project its a great place to learn but lacks work life balance. Team dynamics is all that matters there, Overall its a good place to work at"
"If you are thinking that every team and department at Amazon is equally treated and valued and paid, then I hate to burst your bubble. Amazon is best for individuals coming from CS background or having sound technical knowledge, as the ones working in AWS ( Amazon Web Services) are the ones who are paid handsomely.  Apart from that, all other teams, and specially the ones falling under SDS department are working on peanuts without any substantial hike since the last 3-4 years.  All in all, Amazon is a good company, but only if you land up in the correct team cuz the life on both sides of this giant company is pretty different."
"If you are taking care of personal needs, work is good. Organization structure happen frequently."
"If you are really interested to learn and work, the company provides with ample support. Even though we have lots of work, the atmosphere will not allow the stress to get the better of you. they conduct multiple competitions to encourage new ideas."
"If you are looking for a much relaxed job at one level, Amazon is best for that.. Working environment is good, fun activities, no dress code.. One of the best place.."
"if the work inflow is more, push yourself to extend working hours without any extra benefits and if it is less support team or enjoy free time. I learnt more about supply chain, how work flows from order to cash and also the way of interaction with various stake holders. Management are supportive if you are hardworking. Work culture is enjoyable, no restrictions for having little fun. lack of training on new projects and working on weekends good colleagues and fun talks."
"If Opportunity is earth, Capgemini is Ocean in that.  You will have huge opportunity to Travel abroad and get the process and stabilize at offshore location."
"If looking for a career and exposure to a global MNC Dell India is the place International BPO standards are available Many verticals like Sales , IT , Tech Support etc are available within organisation which can be used as a platform to build a career growth."
"If I have to write about a day at Oracle, probably one of the most spectacular day would be the Q1 kick off, which is one of the most grand and awaited events of the year. In this event the entire sales team gathers to have fun and make merry in the grandest hotels in the city, to start off the new financial year in a happy note. It is no less than a red carpet treatment for team, with an entire spread different cuisine which includes vibrant Italian dishes to Chinese, Mexican, US and simple Indian dishes, the choices are endless. The event kicks off with a speech from the vice president with the achievements of the previous financial year and a road map of the new financial year, then the various teams perform their acts with skids, drama and mimicry, finally followed by the band performance and the then awards and recognitions are distributed. At the end of the event we dance to the beats of the DJ and the cocktails are served. It is indeed the most fun filled day we have in office and a day we would all look forward to."
If amazon is your first company then you will find it difficult to work somewhere else in India because the leverages amazon gives you and work life balance you won't find elsewhere.

"I was working with an housing finance company where in I got an opportunity to work with an extant new generation bank of late 90s called AXIS Bank.  During initial years or early 2000 this bank was famous for  state from the heart banking as it had both human touch and technology as a part of organizational culture. I was able to connect with all the stake holders i.e. Management, colleagues and customer.  The culture was both employee and customer friendly with immense power to the employees despite being a lower rank officer in initial stages of my career I was able to get big accounts as well as get the products customised for the customers. The flexibility of organisation for customer makes a job most interesting. The use of technology for the growth of bank and customer was quite encouraging.  Now the bank is many times bigger and very less flexible this made things very hard and human resources with time just became head counts. This made things quite challenging.  I got immense experience in both the retail as well as asset sides of the banking and being a branch head at various centers  was also responsible for team handling the profitability of the branch."

"I have been working at Cognizant Technology Solutions full-time Pros I joined Cognizant in July, 2014 as a fresher and fortunately, I am going to leave it in few days. There are not much pros. After thinking hard, I was able to come across with few of them. 1. If you do not want to work much or stretch yourself, this is a place for you. It is a relaxed kind of job for freshers like any government job 2. Basic amenities and infrastructure of any location are very good. Cons 1. It is often tough for a fresher to get his/her first project after the completion of training. 50% of them remain in bench for a lond period of time which does not count to their professional experience much. 2. Even if some freshers get deployed into project immediately after the training (the lucky ones), they may get maintenance work, ticketing etc. which is a sheer waste of their talent. Only around 20% of the people ( who are deployed into the project) get some good work like that of a developer. Hence, we see that around 10% of the freshers manage to get some good stuff. 3. Salary is very bad for the freshers. Hike is also extremely poor. 4. Unlike other IT companies like Infosys, low level management is extremely bad. There will be absolutely no one to guide you if you want some kind of help. They do not care about freshers. Many a times, it is like you are on your own. 5. Bad training. Seriously, their only aim is to anyhow complete the training. 6. Deployment of freshers into the project is completey random. A guy who is not much technically sound can get a very good project while the"

Continuous Learning
"Considering this was my first job, I learnt a lot during my association with Accenture. It is considered as one of the big brands in software field.  I have learned a lot from this job, as I was so inexperience when I had joined but after joining this co. I came to know a lot about the corporate world that how challenging it is to stay there with a good performance, I have realized that practically working in a multinational co. is totally different from the theoretical part. The management is so kind & always ready to give some good advises which can be so useful, co-workers are also very homely & helpful who are always ready to guide us. The hardest part of the job is to continue with a good result & to keep patience with the clients as they always like, ignoring you all the time, but the most enjoyable part is to work in this kind of an atmosphere along with the kind of colleagues & to build a good relationship with several clients."

Comparitively less hikes but best place to manage work life balance. Management is cooparative and work timings depends on project and management only.
Compare to GNSA Infotech this is ok type of concern. Work balance is ok anyway not manageable. So seeking for the other jobs. I hope this is more to say about TCS.

Please note that this review is particular to CSIL (GPC, Gurgaon)."

"Because you have a lot of knowledge about your business, it's easy to forget that not everyone knows what your business is about. Avoid saying ""We"" in the beginning sentence: Start off with your company's name and immediately follow it with what your business does --- for example, write ""John Smith Vending is dedicated to servicing our customers with a wide array of vending machines and products.""  ""I"" when writing about your company. For example, write ""John Smith Vending sells both drink and snack products"" rather than ""I sell vending products."" The former sounds more professional and traditional when it comes to an owner describing his business.  Anticipates exceeding expectations, fixing problems and expanding.

Periodic short intervals helps me in maintaining my focus without physical exertion, followed by timed lunch and snacks to keep the energy high at work and since i have a family, i aim to stick to my timelines so that we can spend time together while agendas and tasks remain  On a daily basis, i get a lot of clarity with regards to people management, ever changing dynamics of the industry and its impact on the organization and our reaction to remain competitive and enhance value to our customers/clients/stakeholders. What strikes about the management is that being from very humble backgrounds, they understand the finer intricacies about the situation and provide a helping hand not just to resolve a situation but also to streamline the future. The age bracket of people who i have worked with range from college fresher’s to people on the verge of retirement, which infuses ideas which are fresh and also ideas evolved over a period of time with a lot of experience, which is turn has helped me understand complexities much better and simultaneously understand patterns of human behavior. Each days comes with its own dynamics and the best part of my work is that i get a chance to learn something every day which could range from people"
